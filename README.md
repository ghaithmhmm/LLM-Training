## 🎓 How to Use LLM-Training

### 🌟 Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
With the SFT feature, you can train your model using synthetic data. Here’s how to use this feature:

1. **Prepare Your Dataset**
   - Use the dataset from [joyce8/EMBER2024-capa](https://huggingface.co/datasets/joyce8/EMBER2024-capa) to get started.

2. **Generate Synthetic Data**
   - Utilize the script `create_sft_dataset.py` located in the application folder. Running this will help you create a dataset tailored for training.

3. **Train Your Model**
   - To train the model, use the script named `sft.py`. This will begin the training process with the prepared dataset.

### 🏆 Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
RLVR allows enhanced training of your model through additional reinforcement learning techniques.

1. **Set Up the Verifier**
   - Use the `capa verifier` to verify the rewards during training.

2. **Train the Model**
   - Start the RL training using the `rlvr.py`. This script will guide you through the process, allowing you to leverage the rewards effectively.
